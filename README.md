# shopii

Created at the Women in Engineering's hackathon held at Google.

shopii is a website used to organise shopping lists and add budgets to your account. Lists such as shopping, wish list, etc. can be added and budgets for shopping and spending along with percentage of income can be added. The website calculates the time needed to save up enough money and how much should be budgeted for each buy. 

Welcome to shopii!
